						<p style="margin-top:3%;margin-bottom:3%"><i>The following is a lightly edited transcript of Cabin's interview with The Archivist.</i></p>
						<p style="margin-top:inherit;margin-bottom:inherit"><b>Drunk:</b> Welcome!</p>
						<p style="margin-top:inherit;margin-bottom:inherit"><b>Cabin:</b> Hi, thanks for having me.</p>
						<p style="margin-top:inherit;margin-bottom:inherit"><b>Drunk:</b> So, let's get started with a bit about your personal life. What do you do when not running the Senate, along with your other roles?</p>
						<p style="margin-top:inherit;margin-bottom:inherit"><b>Cabin:</b> Well these days, not a whole lot outside of work. Sticking to quarantine at home with my fianc√©. I do enjoy biking, and try to get out in the few spare moments I have laying around.</p>
						<p style="margin-top:inherit;margin-bottom:inherit"><b>Drunk:</b> When did you first become interested in politics, and what made you choose a career in the field?</p>
						<p style="margin-top:inherit;margin-bottom:inherit"><b>Cabin:</b> I've always been passively interested, living in and around Iowa when I was younger always kept politics close with top politicians making their rounds. I never planned to go into it myself, I spent several years in medical research after grad school. But after a while I saw the country changing dramatically, and I decided I could do more good from a policy standpoint than I could in my field at the time.</p>
						<p style="margin-top:inherit;margin-bottom:inherit"><b>Drunk:</b> Could you give us a brief rundown of your political career so far?</p>
						<p style="margin-top:inherit;margin-bottom:inherit"><b>Cabin:</b> Oh geez, I can try, though I'm pretty sure my wiki page has the full list. I started out in the Jefferson Parliament, then to the House. I went to Dixie Senate and Assembly, then Dixie Governor, back to the House as Speaker, and now to VP and Delegate. I was also Chief of Staff to President LOTR and Treasury Secretary for Valerie.</p>
						<p style="margin-top:inherit;margin-bottom:inherit"><b>Drunk:</b> Out of the many positions you've held, which one would you say has been your favorite?</p>
						<p style="margin-top:inherit;margin-bottom:inherit"><b>Cabin:</b> That's tough, they've each had their ups and downs. If I had to choose, probably Speaker of the House</p>
						<p style="margin-top:inherit;margin-bottom:inherit"><b>Drunk:</b> What would you say were the highest and lowest points of your career?</p>
						<p style="margin-top:inherit;margin-bottom:inherit"><b>Cabin:</b> The high was probably being overwhelmingly confirmed to the vice presidency from congressmen left, right, and center. It capped what I've strove to make a career focused on people, not party affiliation.</p>
						<p style="margin-top:inherit;margin-bottom:inherit"><b>Cabin:</b> I would say that the low came early in my career, when I got caught up in a primary scandal with LOTR, who was essentially mentoring me at the time. It was a lapse in judgement I've tried to avoid ever since.</p>
						<p style="margin-top:inherit;margin-bottom:inherit"><b>Drunk:</b> What would you say has been your greatest political achievement?</p>
						<p style="margin-top:inherit;margin-bottom:inherit"><b>Cabin:</b> In terms of politicking, or like policy accomplishments?</p>
						<p style="margin-top:inherit;margin-bottom:inherit"><b>Drunk:</b> Policy accomplishments, or perhaps what helped the people the most.</p>
						<p style="margin-top:inherit;margin-bottom:inherit"><b>Cabin:</b> I'm going to pair my addiction treatment bills on the state and federal levels and say that's been the achievement I'm most proud of. It's an issue close to my heart, and it means a lot to have made in impact on the lives of those trying to get out of that hole.</p>
						<p style="margin-top:inherit;margin-bottom:inherit"><b>Drunk:</b> Which positions would you consider holding in the future?</p>
						<p style="margin-top:inherit;margin-bottom:inherit"><b>Cabin:</b> Well as you know I'm seeking to continue on as VP for at least another few months with Gov. Garland. After that, I'm not quite sure. I've done about all there is to do outside of the presidency and the courts. I may just take some time to build up The Public Record.</p>
						<p style="margin-top:inherit;margin-bottom:inherit"><b>Drunk:</b> Tell me more about The Public Record. What prompted you to create it, and do you have any comments on the recent acquisition of the former Veritas Post Podcast?</p>
						<p style="margin-top:inherit;margin-bottom:inherit"><b>Cabin:</b> I just thought that there was a gap in regular, high quality news without a spin. The Veritas Post was running out of steam, so I looked to have TPR fill the gap it would be leaving. I'm glad that Order agreed to come on board, and having him run The Truth on our platform makes us better. We're hopefully going to be expanding even farther soon, with more podcasts and starting up more regular polling.</p>
						<p style="margin-top:inherit;margin-bottom:inherit"><b>Drunk:</b> Who would you say was your favorite politician to work with?</p>
						<p style="margin-top:inherit;margin-bottom:inherit"><b>Cabin:</b> In recent memory, I've had a great working relationship with HHS Secretary Barch as we try to navigate the pandemic. Though there are countless people I've enjoyed crafting policy with over my career.</p>
						<p style="margin-top:inherit;margin-bottom:inherit"><b>Drunk:</b> Now, one final question from me. Could you sum up your career in a few sentences?</p>
						<p style="margin-top:inherit;margin-bottom:inherit"><b>Cabin:</b> I've spent my career with an eye to one basic principle. The work I do should benefit everyone that I represent, regardless of whether they support me. I don't believe in a system where half the district, or state, or country loves you and the other half hates you. I want to be better than that.</p>
						<p style="margin-top:inherit;margin-bottom:inherit"><b>Drunk:</b> Thank you very much for your time, Cabin. It's been great having you here.</p>
						<p style="margin-top:inherit;margin-bottom:inherit"><b>Cabin:</b> Thanks again for having me, it was a pleasure.</p>
