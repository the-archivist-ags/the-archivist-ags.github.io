						<p style="margin-top:3%;margin-bottom:3%"><i>The following is a lightly edited transcript of System's interview with The Archivist.</i></p>
						<p style="margin-top:inherit;margin-bottom:inherit"><b>Drunk:</b> Welcome. Thanks for joining us.</p>
						<p style="margin-top:inherit;margin-bottom:inherit"><b>System:</b> Thanks for having me.</p>
						<p style="margin-top:inherit;margin-bottom:inherit"><b>Drunk:</b> So, shall we begin with a little bit about your personal life? What do you do when not on the clock?</p>
						<p style="margin-top:inherit;margin-bottom:inherit"><b>System:</b> I hangout with my family at my home, and I'm a big gamer.</p>
						<p style="margin-top:inherit;margin-bottom:inherit"><b>Drunk:</b> What got you into politics in the first place?</p>
						<p style="margin-top:inherit;margin-bottom:inherit"><b>System:</b> I wanted to create a real and lasting change on our country.</p>
						<p style="margin-top:inherit;margin-bottom:inherit"><b>Drunk:</b> Did you do anything significant before politics?</p>
						<p style="margin-top:inherit;margin-bottom:inherit"><b>System:</b> I was a successful business owner, many people don't know I'm actually a billionaire.</p>
						<p style="margin-top:inherit;margin-bottom:inherit"><b>Drunk:</b> Now, could you give us a brief rundown of your political career so far?</p>
						<p style="margin-top:inherit;margin-bottom:inherit"><b>System:</b> I ran for President against Poke and dropped out to support Shitmemery, which my party hated and my party didnt support him and ended up allowing Poke to become President, shortly after the United Right party which I was the Chair of at the time crumbled and eventually rebranded to GOP 2, that cumbled and then I left public life for a while and when I returned I became President Politophile's Vice President, and after that I've just been in the House, Senate, Parliament, Governor, State Justice and as of right now im a MP, Member of the House and running for President.</p>
						<p style="margin-top:inherit;margin-bottom:inherit"><b>Drunk:</b> What would you say were the highest and lowest points of your career?</p>
						<p style="margin-top:inherit;margin-bottom:inherit"><b>System:</b> Highest point hasn't happened yet, waiting to become President one day, lowest point would probably being removed as Speaker for my "deep state" which it wasnt but I was deeply upset considering I was Speaker the previous session for the back half of it and we had the most efficient House ever I believe.</p>
						<p style="margin-top:inherit;margin-bottom:inherit"><b>Drunk:</b> What would you say was your greatest political achievement so far?</p>
						<p style="margin-top:inherit;margin-bottom:inherit"><b>System:</b> Being Vice President so shortly after return to politics. That, and getting the ATF Act passed in the House, I don't think it ever reached the Senate floor or signed. I could be mistaken though.</p>
						<p style="margin-top:inherit;margin-bottom:inherit"><b>Drunk:</b> If you ever become President, what will you do after that?</p>
						<p style="margin-top:inherit;margin-bottom:inherit"><b>System:</b> Retire. That is my last position I want to hold before I retire, I believe once I'm President and do what I can, after that I've done all I can to create a lasting impression on this country</p>
						<p style="margin-top:inherit;margin-bottom:inherit"><b>Drunk:</b> Finally, could you sum up your career in one or two sentences?</p>
						<p style="margin-top:inherit;margin-bottom:inherit"><b>System:</b> I've made mistakes, but I hope when I retire everyone will remember me for the good I've done.</p>
						<p style="margin-top:inherit;margin-bottom:inherit"><b>Drunk:</b> Thank you for your time.</p>
						<p style="margin-top:inherit;margin-bottom:inherit"><b>System:</b> Thank you for having me.</p>
