						<p style="margin-top:3%;margin-bottom:3%"><i>The following is a lightly edited transcript of John Smith's interview with The Archivist.</i></p>
						<p style="margin-top:inherit;margin-bottom:inherit"><b>Drunk:</b> Welcome!</p>
						<p style="margin-top:inherit;margin-bottom:inherit"><b>John Smith:</b> Thank you for inviting me.</a>
						<p style="margin-top:inherit;margin-bottom:inherit"><b>Drunk:</b> Let's begin away from your career. What did you do, if anything, before you got into politics?</p>
						<p style="margin-top:inherit;margin-bottom:inherit"><b>John Smith:</b> I was an insurance lawyer, basically when an insurance company tried to screw a customer over, I helped the customer get what they deserved.</p>
						<p style="margin-top:inherit;margin-bottom:inherit"><b>Drunk:</b> Where did you start out in politics, and what got you into it?</p>
						<p style="margin-top:inherit;margin-bottom:inherit"><b>John Smith:</b> Well I started when I decided to get involved with the Republicans, which were the main right wing party at the time. There I met John Boehner, who has been a guide and friend to me throughout my political career. I started by running for house in a special election. I lost but it gave me name recognition. I got into politics because I had many ideas and wanted to enact them.</p>
						<p style="margin-top:inherit;margin-bottom:inherit"><b>Drunk:</b> Could you give us a brief rundown of your political career so far?</p>
						<p style="margin-top:inherit;margin-bottom:inherit"><b>John Smith:</b> That's a long story. I lost that special election, I believe it was NS-7. Sometime after that I won election to the Dixie Assembly where served for one term before losing reelection, I believe it was another special election. Then Governor Webb appointed me to represent Dixie in the Senate. I later won a special election for that seat and went on to be President Pro Tempore during most of the Patty administration. Due to a botched primary with the Federalists I didn't go for reelection and instead ran for the DX-2 house seat, which I hold to this day. I later won election to the Assembly to the DX-2 seat which I held until last June. I worked my way to Speaker of the Assembly which I held for quite a while. Sometime after that I started the Conservative party as I was fed up with the Federalists and the corruption that was occurring at the time. This allowed me to become Speaker of the House for a full term and later we rejoined the Federalists after major changes were made. After the collapse of the Federalists I joined the Classical Liberals and have now founded the Tea Party.</p>
						<p style="margin-top:inherit;margin-bottom:inherit"><b>Drunk:</b> Interesting. Tell us about the Tea Party. What inspired you to create it, and why did you?</p>
						<p style="margin-top:inherit;margin-bottom:inherit"><b>John Smith:</b> Well after the New Republicans failed, they had honestly been dying even when they were the Classical Liberals I saw that there was no political options for the mainstream right wing. So I created a party for just that. Nothing too complicated.</p>
						<p style="margin-top:inherit;margin-bottom:inherit"><b>Drunk:</b> Of all the positions you've held, which has been your favorite?</p>
						<p style="margin-top:inherit;margin-bottom:inherit"><b>John Smith:</b> While I enjoyed being presiding officer of 3 legislative bodies, they were very stressful positions and I often felt like there was a target on my back. My favorite would have to be as a member of the Dixie Assembly, I feel I've done the most there and enjoyed it.</p>
						<p style="margin-top:inherit;margin-bottom:inherit"><b>Drunk:</b> What would you say were the highest and lowest points of your career?</p>
						<p style="margin-top:inherit;margin-bottom:inherit"><b>John Smith:</b> The highest would definitely be when I was speaker of the house, it's the highest position I've ever held and I feel the house ran smoothly during my tenure. It's a part I do look back fondly on. The lowest would probably be when I lost reelection to the Assembly the first time, it was my first real defeat and I didn't hold any other positions at the time, not to mention the new administration in Dixie was attempting to undo a lot of the work I had done.</p>
						<p style="margin-top:inherit;margin-bottom:inherit"><b>Drunk:</b> What's next in your career?</p>
						<p style="margin-top:inherit;margin-bottom:inherit"><b>John Smith:</b> I plan to do some good this term in the House, I'm chairman of the Commerce, Education, and Infrastructure committee and I've already proposed a bill, the Interstate Healthcare Transparency Act.</p>
						<p style="margin-top:inherit;margin-bottom:inherit"><b>Drunk:</b> Are there any positions you are eying up for the future?</p>
						<p style="margin-top:inherit;margin-bottom:inherit"><b>John Smith:</b> One I've actually been pursuing since the days of Khalil is the Governorship of Dixie. Its been a longtime goal for me and I plan to run for it in September.</p>
						<p style="margin-top:inherit;margin-bottom:inherit"><b>Drunk:</b> Interesting. Who would you say was your favorite politician to work with?</p>
						<p style="margin-top:inherit;margin-bottom:inherit"><b>John Smith:</b> John Boehner, he's been a longtime friend and we make a great team. We are also extremely similar ideologically</p>
						<p style="margin-top:inherit;margin-bottom:inherit"><b>Drunk:</b> Now, as we wrap up, could you sum up your career in a few sentences?</p>
						<p style="margin-top:inherit;margin-bottom:inherit"><b>John Smith:</b> I am a conservative dedicated to freedom and justice. I have a very long career and have led political parties. Along with presiding the House, Senate, and the Dixie Assembly. Above all I am a principled man.</p>
						<p style="margin-top:inherit;margin-bottom:inherit"><b>Drunk:</b> Thank you for your time, Mr Smith. It's been a pleasure.</p>
						<p style="margin-top:inherit;margin-bottom:inherit"><b>John Smith:</b> It has been my pleasure as well.</p>
