						<p style="margin-top:3%;margin-bottom:3%"><i>The following is a lightly edited transcript of Garland's interview with The Archivist.</i></p>
						<p style="margin-top:inherit;margin-bottom:inherit"><b>SteB:</b> Hello Governor, it's a pleasure to have you here today.</p>
						<p style="margin-top:inherit;margin-bottom:inherit"><b>Garland:</b> Thank you for having me on today for this program.</a>
						<p style="margin-top:inherit;margin-bottom:inherit"><b>SteB:</b> So, I would like to start with your childhood. Could you give us a brief rundown of your early life?</p>
						<p style="margin-top:inherit;margin-bottom:inherit"><b>Garland:</b> I was born in New York City, to my father Cory, an Engineer, and my mother Maria, a Teacher. When I was around seven my family moved to Massachusetts, where I spent the rest of my childhood and early adulthood, eventually graduating from a local college.</p>
						<p style="margin-top:inherit;margin-bottom:inherit"><b>SteB:</b> What made you want to get involved in politics in the first place?</p>
						<p style="margin-top:inherit;margin-bottom:inherit"><b>Garland:</b> What got me interested in politics was the absence of diversity within the thoughts, experiences, and approaches of lawmakers. I’m someone who didn’t study political science in college, I’m not a lawyer by trade nor attended an Ivy League university, people like me were absent at the time. I had the opportunity to do something different, to represent my community outside of the bubble and produce tangible improvements to the quality of life of my constituents by utilizing a different set of background and experiences.</p>
						<p style="margin-top:inherit;margin-bottom:inherit"><b>SteB:</b> Did you do anything significant before politics?</p>
						<p style="margin-top:inherit;margin-bottom:inherit"><b>Garland:</b> After college, I moved to San Jose, California where I began my career in the private sector working in financial services. After a few years, I worked with some colleagues to establish Brandies LLC which aimed to provide honest and fair reporting of news events through the magazine format, I served as the Chief Executive Officer of Brandeis for around ten years. As shown as late as a year ago, it was one of the more well-respected publications in the country. Upon becoming more involved within the political realm, I relinquished my ownership.</p>
						<p style="margin-top:inherit;margin-bottom:inherit"><b>SteB:</b> Moving onto politics, could you give us a brief rundown of your political career so far?</p>
						<p style="margin-top:inherit;margin-bottom:inherit"><b>Garland:</b> Sure, I was initially elected to the House of Representatives representing the North’s fifth Congressional District. Upon the sudden resignation of Sen. Boehner, I was appointed to fill his vacancy by Gov. Hale, eventually serving in that office for a full six-month term and elected to a second one. During my time in the Senate, I served as the Senior Senator representing the North, and as it eldest member, I was elected President pro tempore for a full session. Following my election to the Senate, I threw my hat into the Gubernatorial race in the North, winning as a nonpartisan candidate. Recently I had the honor of being re-elected to this office unanimously. In between these offices, I served as a Member of the House of Delegates for two terms,  Secretary of Defense under Presidents LOTR and Patty, Secretary of the Treasury under Presidents MichiganLefty, Barch, and Patty, and most recently as Ambassador to the United Nations under President Valerie.</p>
						<p style="margin-top:inherit;margin-bottom:inherit"><b>SteB:</b> What would you say was your greatest political achievement?</p>
						<p style="margin-top:inherit;margin-bottom:inherit"><b>Garland:</b>Throughout my time in public office, I’ve had ample opportunities to promote change in this country from issues related to consumer safety, union membership, our environment, and sustainable development, and even our sources of energy at both the state and federal levels. I think there are two achievements that I hold dear, Immigration and Education. As a member of Congress, I helped fight for vital protections for undocumented immigrants particularly minors, I fought to ensure that victims of human trafficking on our Southern Border were spared the cruelty of deportation and second class citizenship. My caucus and I worked across the aisle with a Republican Administration in the White House to establish the most comprehensive immigration reform package since the 1960s. On the state level, my greatest achievement has been education, I once again worked across the aisle in a divided House to fundamentally change the way schools operate in our state, decoupling school funding from municipal property taxes, developing safe and good quality schools in our most impoverished communities and working to end the once rampant boundaries set in place to prevent access to quality education. Additionally, we worked to provide an innovative model of education, providing support for public, private, and charter schools and ensuring that regardless of where a child attended school or their household income, they would receive the best-quality education.</p>
						<p style="margin-top:inherit;margin-bottom:inherit"><b>SteB:</b> Could you tell us a bit about your personal life?</p>
						<p style="margin-top:inherit;margin-bottom:inherit"><b>Garland:</b> Before we moved to Chicago after the Gubernational Election, I lived my wife and three young children in Rhode Island. We would consider ourselves fans of the outdoors when it was summertime we enjoyed the beaches, swimming, surfing and being by the ocean. Obviously given the circumstances, that may not be an option right now, so its homework help and video games for the time being. Since the quarantine, I’ve been picking up on my reading and exploring the fiction genre, something I rarely tend to do.</p>
						<p style="margin-top:inherit;margin-bottom:inherit"><b>SteB:</b> It's been wonderful having you here. My final question is; could you sum up your career in one or two sentences?</p>
						<p style="margin-top:inherit;margin-bottom:inherit"><b>Garland:</b> I’m someone who embraces progressive change, I don’t simply nibble around the edges on the policy. Throughout my career, I have worked to design and implement policy that positively impacts the most amount of people as possible, often directly challenging the Washington consensus. I’m going to continue being myself, someone who governs based on collaboration, discourse, and input from others rather than from fear or coercion.</p>
						<p style="margin-top:inherit;margin-bottom:inherit"><b>SteB:</b> Thank you, this has been truly great. Good night, Governor.</p>
						<p style="margin-top:inherit;margin-bottom:inherit"><b>Garland:</b> Thank you once again.</p>
