Though state and house districts don’t align perfectly, some of the NS-4 district in the house overlaps with the NS-4 district in the state assembly. I know these people. I represent them. 
I also have experience surrounding the environment. The first thing I did as Representative was write and later submit the Green Employment Act, one of the main campaigning points during the last election. I am in the process of becoming the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency.
I am also a Journalist, for ABC News. I have experience analysing the situation and keeping the public informed.
I believe my combined qualifications of being a Representative, an Environmental Activist and Journalist will make the People of the NS-4 district glad to see me represent them in the State Assembly.</div>

I believe that I would be qualified to serve in this position, since my legal experience in consulting with the President, has given me the abilitybeing able to be able to insert the major policy challenges that we face in our country. One of the concerns we have seen fro the White House is the fact that many federal policy proposals being developed by Congress are still state-level issues, which unfournantely have not been taken up at the state level, due to inactive leadership. For long time, we&#39;ve had leaders in the House of Delegates, who also being apart of Congress not being able to equally protitize both positions in the past and in more recent times. Though I am also serving at the federal level, I am serving in an executive position with limited authority, which I believe gives me suffieicnt time in paying attention to the concerns of the Northern people, compared to others in DC, who have indeed neglected this. Which is why I believe that the Northern people in District 4, would be well represeted if I am giving the chance to be elected to this horbaable position.</div>

You say you would be better suited to serve the people, but you have no experience representing anyone in any legislature.

And again looking at you own record, you have also been in Congress for only 2 weeks, so if we are going on political experience overall, I have far more in that realm. Additionally, you have deflected my issue of the consitutional concners of many federal proposals, not being properly introduced at the state level, which not only applies toyiu, but also ALC leadership. The fact you have chosen to ignore this concern even as a I am currently your xonsiutient reflects poorly in your leadership skills. I also detest you for calling me incompetent, seeing as your recommendation d shows you being one of the more inactive members of the House. If you cannot fully keep the responsibilities as a House member, what makes you sure you can do it also at the state level. I believe my limited commitments at the federal level would give me vast time, far more than you could, in tending to the needs of the people in the Northern State in the House of Delegates.</div>

The state would subsidise the employment of people in private green energy companies.  This would both help the green energy companies develop, and allow them to employ more workers, helping fix the covid-19 unemployment crisis. Overall, I believe hydroelectric power is currently the best renewable energy source. It&#39;s cheaper than any alternative energy source, even nuclear power. However, with more research and development, I believe other renewable forms of energy, solar power chief among them, could overtake hydroelectricty as the cheapest form of energy. Therefore, I Intend to build more hydroelectric facilities, but also develop better renewable energy sources.</div>

                    <div class="markdown">The death penalty system in the US is inhumane and unfair. People of color are far more likely to be executed than white people, especially if the victim is white. A good attorney, which only rich people can afford, dramatically decreases a persons chances of being sentenced to death. Money could decide if you live or die. The death penalty is a waste of taxpayer funds and has no public safety benefit. The vast majority of law enforcement professionals surveyed agree that capital punishment does not deter violent crime; a survey of police chiefs nationwide found they rank the death penalty lowest among ways to reduce violent crime. The FBI has found the states with the death penalty have the highest murder rates.
Innocent people are too often sentenced to death.  Since 1973, over 156 people have been released from death rows in 26 states because of innocence.  Nationally, at least one person is exonerated for every 10 that are executed. Even if the chances of killing an innocent person are not large, it is possible that the death penalty would condemn thousands of innocent people to their graves. It’s barbaric. My Prison reform program hopes to focus prison much more on rehabilitation than punishment, and killing people can not allow them to change or re-enter society. It doesn’t benefit the state or its people, and it costs money and innocent lives.</div>

                    <div class="markdown"><span class="mention" title="bob2boy#7855">@AG bob2boy</span> Thank for the question you asked about energy reform. So what I believe is, as I have made clear consistently throughout various election cycles, is that I believe that investing into nuclear power infrasutucuture, through public-private partnerships, is the only logical way forward as an eco-effiecent source of energy. Nuclear energy has proven itself to be the energy source that can produced at a mass level (As we can see in our allied country of France), compared to either hydro or wind energy, which are more costly forms that also yield less energy. I have also declared in the last election that at the federal level I pledged to propose an &quot;eco zone&quot; program, with accountability, where tax breaks would be awarded progressivly overtime with the correpsondence of &quot;green investments&quot; in select communties, especially those where people are distressed, whehther that be inner city Baltimore, or in the coal mining communties of western Pennsyvlania. At the same time, we must be pragmatic in our approach, in that we want to prevent displacement of workers, which number to the hundreds of thousands in our labor workforce, espeically in the oil and natural gas sectors. It is why in the last election I was proud to also propose a plan at the federal level to propose a new program (A plan that can also be further fleshed-out at the state level proposed if I am elected to the House), where workers from eligble companies, who will be out of bussiness in a few years, can buy out shares to give them some financial cushoning, to reduce the effects of displacement. My approach as you can see is cooperation with the private-sector, so that we can maxmise sustaninable innovation, while minimizing any harms in our transition to more renweble energy.</div>

                    <div class="markdown">The north has hundreds of rivers which could be potentially dammed. Though they sometimes have negative environmental impacts, which can be greatly minimised the case if the location is chosen correctly, they have many other positive impacts. Hydroelectric facilitated reduce flooding, which saves billions in property damage costs, it allows for better irrigation, supporting the Northern Farming industry, and provides the area with a fresh supply of water. Hydroelectric installations bring electricity, highways, industry and commerce to communities, thus developing the economy, expanding access to health and education, and improving the quality of life. Hydroelectricity is a technology that has been known and proven for more than a century. Its impacts are well understood and manageable through measures for mitigating and compensating the damages. It offers a vast potential and is available where development is most necessary. Though Nuclear power is safe, it does produce toxic by-products, which is extremely difficult to dispose of, while Hydroelectric power does not. Furthermore, nuclear power relies on a supply of nuclear materials while Hydropower is completely self sufficient. Nuclear facilities cost billions of dollars to produce, while the price of Hydroelectricity is much lower. I do not believe nuclear power is bad, or that is should not be funded. I simply believe hydroelectricity is a much better form of producing electricity.</div>

In all of the various election cycles at the federal level (This is my first state-level race), I have given in-depth explantion for my proposals in a wide range of ideas, from my vision of free-market enviormentalism (Which I explained in some of this debate), to my belief in expanding access to financial services to minority communities, to establishing categoricial grant programs for gun safety training, along with the establishment of a red flag law (Which is something I would work to bring in the North), and even my initiaitves of the re-intergration of felons into society, to ensure that they don&#39;t fall into a trap of poverty leading them back to incaceraction. Even when taking a look at your (I would say well-designed website), it basically only mentioned some concreate proposals (Which I would still say is laudible), 1) Life-Learning classes (An idea I agree with, as a show of my bipartisnahsip), 2) Increasing teacher pay and funding (It does&#39;nt specify how however, which I believe is criticial to note; just FYI my education policy that I have mentioned in that past was to also expand trade school and community college opertunties for displaced workers, adding on the energy disscussion). I also support a transition also from ridigid subject-based learning to more intergrated skills-based classroom learning, which I hope to work with the State Board of Education from a legislative perspective. Your next category is for punishing people who propogate &quot;hate speech&quot; against LGBTQ pouplations. I support the notion that hate speech is dispicable,</div>

                    <div class="markdown">however I fear that your approach may involve enchroching on 1st amendment rights, which as a legal official (Being AG) would have concerning ramifications, which is why my approach instead would be to support funding of reconcilation programs so that tolerance of different people can be established (Which has been seen through sucessful restorative justice programs with the KKK meeting members of the African American communities), with also promoting PSA campaigns of tolerance and diversity to further dissuade discrimination. I have also supported the Valarie Adminstration&#39;s renweed authorization of Civil Rights legislation, which is why in addtion to that I support increased enforcement of 14th amendment protections, through legislation emboldening prosucetion of extremist violent groups at the state level of those who actively discriminate, especially in light of attempts of groups to dirupt Pride Month celebrations. When we look at your climate plans, I have made it clear already that my approach would differ in being more oriented toward cooperation with the private-sector (As I have disscussed in depth), instead of sheer government intervention. Lastly when it comes to criminal justice matters, the only thing in your website is to reduce incraceration. My proposals address that, along with the support of faith-based reabiltiive groups as you have mentioned, but also go far beyond, as I have mentioned with expanding re-integration of felon efforts; through conditional work release programs and asissitance in accessing fianncial services, etc. I would also be open to reforming sentencing guidelines to ensure that people are not given punitive punishments.<span class="chatlog__edited-timestamp" title="07-Jun-20 07:42 PM">(edited)</span></div>

                    <div class="markdown">The education system must be reformed. As laid out in my multiple campaign projects, the curriculum and the way schools are run must change.

Teenage suicide is a huge problem facing our nation today. Teenagers every day commit suicide, due to stress, bullying, or other factors. We must tackle this head on. Psychiatrist must be appointed at <em>every single</em> school, working with the children to solve their issues. The state should make under-18 psychiatric visits free of charge to prevent suicide, self-harm or other negative effects. Bullying cannot be tolerated in any form, and psychiatric help will help with that. Bullying is often caused by problems at home or other issues, which can be resolved by a visit to a psychiatrist.</div>

                    <div class="markdown">The curriculum must also be updated. Much of it is old and currently irrelevant. New ideas and innovations are not added to most subjects. An annual meeting of a state education committee, which would present its findings to the State Legislature which would then vote on their proposal, with specialists from every field along with teachers, could help solve this. New lessons, namely STEM and Life Learning should be added. STEM is a combination is Science, Technology Engineering and Maths and will help students understand how things work practically and how to create objects. Life learning would focus on necessary skills that every adult should possess. Job or college interviews are not taught in school, and they should be. Personal finance management is not taught in school, and it should be. Cooking is not taught in school, and it should be. School should prepare our children for adulthood, and with “Life Learning”, it will. In High School, students should have much more choice as to what they take. They should be able to specialise, dropping subjects and taking others instead. More focused lessons, including learning trades, but also business, economics, sociology or psychology should be available for students. Arts and foreign languages should not be compulsory, and instead students should be able to choose what they want to do with their lives.</div>

                    <div class="markdown"><span class="mention" title="SteB#7085">@Taft&#39;s alt</span> I agree with you on this note, in that we need to have a revised currciulum that truly begins to meet the needs of our youth today. Common Core standards, while was a noble effort in trying to deliver such, ultimamtely exsaberated a lot of the inequtities in our edcuation system. We need true reform that will make the delivery of education for innovative and learning focused, as opposed to the current teaching to the test model that is perputed in our school districts currently. I believe that your STEM plan while notable, has the ringtones of similar plans currently in implementation such as the Next Generation Standards that are being implemented currently in many classrooms throughout the North and much of the nation. I believe efforts such as those are essential in our transofrmation of our education system. I would also like to point out though, the issue is not that there are not course offerings of criticial course, in fact I can attest that in many Northern School Disitircts, courses that Steb refering to such above are in fact options that students can take under the current system.  We need to promote more radical reforms, so we can make the strucutural changes in our education system. I believe that a Finland-styled system for education, with integrated skills, instead ofsubject course, is something that has great merit to implement in the North. Education should not be something that should be an insittional barrier that crushes the creativity of many young minds.. I believe that as Justice Brandies quipped, we ought to use the principles of federalism, of having states being the &quot;labratories of democracies&quot; to unshackle school districts from burdensome standards, and allow for flexible autonomy that will promote regional diversity in tailoring education that fits the needs of diverse pouplations of students accross this North State, which is something I will support if elected as member of the North House of Delegates.</div>
