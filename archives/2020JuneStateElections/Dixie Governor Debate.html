I will fight tooth and nail to make sure the Right to Life Amendment will never be repealed, and if it does I will fight tooth and nail to get abortion banned again. I refuse to compromise, which is why both me and my Lt. Gov, JMP, have been staunchly pro-life for a very long time and were sponsors and collaborators on the RTL Amendment. On the other hand, Sandoval’s choice of Sen. Order, who made fun of infanticide and fought against RTL, as his Lt. Gov and his defense of “the 47% of Dixians that voted against the Right to Life Amendment” are both very concerning. Sandoval is obviously going to try to convince you that he’s perfectly pro-life, but these signs are indicative that he’d be hesitant to defend the pro-life cause in the future at best and completely switching sides at worst. I can tell you that as Governor, abortion will stay banned, and my actions back up my words. Sandoval might promise the world to you when he answers the question, but his actions tell a very different story.</div>

</div><span class="mention" title="Poliman#7886">@Poliman</span>  

Great question as abortion is always a pertinent issue in the state of Dixie. Repeal the amendment? I actually agree with implementing bans through amendments as it requires a referendum to pass. I would not veto any legislation having to do with crafting laws which regulate abortion in the state of Dixie as the Constitution is clear and the people have spoken. My main priority at this point is working with the Assembly on passing laws which lower the rate of abortion, increased access to non-abortive contraceptives, health counseling, more funding towards pregnancy centers and adoption services, etc. What we need to do as a state, if this is the path we <em>truly</em> want to take, is help women and mothers. We cannot just ban a practice and hope it disappears as it seems people like Trash are hoping. They do not realize that in many places where abortion is illegal there are still avenues by which women get them done, and it isn’t safe nor healthy for either party. We need a plan to actually help and engage with our population on this issue and answer the hard questions. Yes, I am very personally opposed to the practice of abortion, and if I were a woman I wouldn’t get one. But guess what? I’m not a woman. In my ideal world there exists a time period where a woman can make a choice for her health. Where a woman can get this procedure done in the event of her rape. Where a woman can live her life freely and rule over her own domain and body.

I pledge to not attempt any repeal of this ban, however in the event that this amendment is overturned as it very well might be, my duty is to inform the public of the facts and answer the hard truths. Trash may deride me for this comment but it’s so very true, that a whopping <em>47%</em> of Dixians who voted, voted “no” on the Right To Life Amendment.</div>

                    <div class="markdown">That is not an insignificant number, and it goes to show that within our state there exists a large amount of people who do not believe a ban from conception is ok. You will see this in my actions, such as helping institute a freer health market place which will only serve to boost women and increase their access to healthcare and lower the need for an abortion in the first place.

“Sandoval might promise the world to you when he answers the question, but his actions tell a very different story.”

At least I have actions. Coming from an extremely inactive and lazy politician who can hardly get a bill passed I don’t really care about this last part. The people of Dixie know who I am, I’ve never run away from my own truth, and I know that I will serve them and their interests well.</div>

                    <div class="markdown">It’s pretty pathetic for you to try to misconstrue my hard support for anti-abortion measures as a statement of ignorance of the reality that abortions often continue illegally. I obviously support expansion of public information campaigns, adoption, counseling, and contraceptives, to the point where I have and will continue to advocate for free and universally available accessibility to applicable services (i.e. contraceptives and counseling), which is a reality that many capitalists like yourself would be afraid to even think about. But, what’s most interesting about your answer wasn’t the ridiculous attack, it was that you proved me right about the shift towards the pro-choice side. The whole portion about how if you were a woman you’d want to be able to make the choice sounds like it came straight from Sen. Order’s hideous website, and I wouldn’t be surprised to find out that he drafted most of your answer for you. I take serious issue with the notion that killing an unborn child is “[a woman’s] choice for her health,” as you so elegantly put it. I don’t believe we should change the Dixie Constitution, as you said, to allow a woman to kill a child “in the event of her rape.” The absolute hypocrisy for a person that once helped write the Right To Life Amendment to be saying that the murder of children is acceptable under the right circumstances “in an ideal world” is straight up disgusting. I knew you planned on contradicting yourself on abortion when you chose Sen. Order as your Lt. Gov, but I never would’ve thought that you would so brazenly violate your own moral axiom like that. Even pro-choicers should wince at the way you are trying to weasel out of taking a solid stance on this question.<span class="chatlog__edited-timestamp" title="06-Jun-20 03:08 AM">(edited)</span></div>

Where in that do you take issue? I am happy though that we agree on some things, and if you do end up back in the Assembly someday I am happy to work with you on future legislation regarding this issue.

To assert that Sen. Order wrote my answer is utterly laughable. I don’t need anyone drafting up responses when I do it perfectly fine myself. You are twisting my words around and hoping to bluff your way through this topic, but my convictions have been the same since Day 1. I know that abortion is your favorite topic, however, since it’s the only issue out of your socialist agenda which some Dixians could agree with. My job will be to represent the people, and that’s what I will do.</div>

Great question! We do have a debt issue in Dixie. I will task my cabinet with coming up with further ideas to increase revenue within the state, much as I helped do as Secretary of Internal Affairs for Governor Cabin. We will also cut unnecessary spending within these departments. Following our freedom from this debt I will institute tax reform to better distribute the tax burden through the use of an LVT.

Another way to help decrease our debt quickly will be through creating a more business friendly environment to bring in more companies, industry, jobs, and therefore revenue. I am currently working on a fantastic budget which I intend on introducing upon my first day in office!</div>

Even when you said “in an ideal world... a woman can get this procedure done in the event of her rape?” I mean that’s just very obviously referring to an anti-abortion stance, especially when you’ve failed to explain how else people can understand those specific comments. 

<div class="quote">what&#39;s your plan to deal with the state debt? 
</div>
I do not think state debt is particularly important, but in the event that Dixie reaches a point where the state debt is insurmountable without measures, I agree that LVT is a good way to raise some revenue to pay off the debt. As a quick aside, I would love to hear what select drugs my opponent would like to legalize seeing as basically every drug has been federally decriminalized within the last few years. 

<div class="quote">opinion on landlords? 
</div>
Landlords are a drain on society. They add nothing of value, yet vampirically steal money from the proletariat. Dixie public housing will be massively expanded if I become Governor, and I have talked with JMP about various measures to decrease landlordship. 

<div class="quote">Recently, a new party calling itself the New Silver League has recently emerged, with several papers referring to it as &#39;fascists&#39;. While they have dropped out of the race, what are the candidate&#39;s opinions on the matter?
</div>
I stand strongly in opposition to fascism as one of the signees and the originator of the condemnation of korncorperal, the NR Party, and April. Socialism as an ideology has long been associated with the battle against fascism. Fascism reproduces and amplifies the same exclusionary logics of capitalism on the basis of race, gender, and sexuality, which is abhorrent. The authoritarian structure of fascist government chokes out basic human rights. It is no wonder that the NSL had to manipulate ryandaly45 to get him to join.<span class="chatlog__edited-timestamp" title="06-Jun-20 04:11 AM">(edited)</span></div>

</div>The statement is pretty clear. A ban hurts women and I gave an example.

“I do not think the state debt is particularly important”. This is just ridiculous. The state should not be paying interest on debt and I believe it is of the utmost importance to remove all debt from our state’s balance sheet. I think it is quite apt for a socialist with huge, costly ideas to not care about government debt, but you don’t realize the issues here and how a state indebted cannot freely represent the people.

In regards to drugs, our state still has harsh drug laws on the books which have not been affected by federal actions. The Assembly has yet to take action here and institute state-level laws which legalize substances like marijuana and incorporate consumption taxes into our budget. I’d like to tackle this during my term as Governor.</div>

Another great question, and especially pertinent considering rising income inequality in our country. What we need to do is shift the tax burden away from the lower class and institute policies which grow jobs and the economy in the areas in which they live. The governments job should only ever be to empower people with increased opportunity and ensure a thriving economy. This means encouraging private industry to invest in economically depressed areas, adding jobs and increased wages along with it.

The second factor is education. We must focus our education less on standardized testing and irrelevant, and oftentimes subjective, standards and instead ensure an atmosphere for students which encourages learning. We must also ensure that educational opportunities are plentiful for people living in poverty or depressed areas of our state. The quickest way out of poverty is through a quality education. I also plan on introducing scholarship programs which can help these students afford college, earn a degree, and live full, productive lives.

Finally the third factor is our unjust criminal justice system which unfairly preys on the poor and minorities. We need reform badly, seen throughout the country as protests rage over the despicable murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer. Harsh sentencing and police policies which encourage heavier policing in poor areas make it incredibly difficult for residents to escape their situation. There has been great reform in this area done throughout the state, however I believe that there is more to do.

Fighting mass poverty involves many factors and many varying policy points, so the solution will change and shift with the times. I do believe that I can lead an effort to combat the causes of poverty and lift Dixians higher than ever before!</div>

                    <div class="markdown"><span class="mention" title="the Majestic Purple Phoenix#3828">@Aegeus Phoenix</span> I have a few plans for economic inequality at large. Unlike Sandoval, I don’t think that allowing companies to prey on Dixians is a good way to balance out wealth inequality. This is not only a common sense point, it’s also historically proven by the Gilded Age or the 1970s and 80s, where awful American politicians like Ronald Reagan put the economy and small government libertarianism ahead of income equality. Instead, we should use the government to ensure that nobody is exploited by capitalism. To start out with, I will return workers’ rights over their own labor by mandating that businesses are owned in large part by workers. This would stop an important issue that many workers face, which is that minimum wage workers at large companies can never escape poverty. If they have a large say in their wages and conditions, they’ll have to worry less about potentially never escaping poverty. Secondly, I will nationalize certain basic needs, like utilities, healthcare, and secondary education. Two huge roadblocks for many people are a. steep prices on goods and services that you absolutely need in order to escape poverty and b. unexpected costs like a pricey medical procedure. Public ownership of these companies would allow Dixie to make sure everyone has access to these crucial and basic needs while simultaneously not having to bankrupt themselves. Finally, a third proposal is my plan to strengthen unions. We can create wage boards to hold negotiations on an industrywide level which would set proper wage and working conditions standards. We can make it easier to join unions by paying union dues directly from the government. We can help workers train for negotiations and for job skills in general with government funded seminars. Strong unions stop the companies from using their overwhelming power to bully the workers into submission, which allows them to access better wages and escape poverty altogether.</div>

I think the Right to Life Amendment hit the perfect spot on abortion, banning all abortions except for in the instance of guaranteed harmed to the mother. I think that determining when life begins is difficult, so it’s safest to assume that it begins at conception so as to not kill children unknowingly. However, when the mother is at risk, the life of a real human being is probably more important than that of a hypothetical human being. But, I don’t think that anyone should be able to have an abortion in any other instance, because that justifies killing fully born children because the mother was a rape victim.</div>

Regardless, we can all agree that abortions need to decrease anyway. We already discussed this above, but I have a much more ambitious plan here than Sandoval. Not only do I support a huge public information campaign and expanded access to pregnancy tests, counseling, and contraceptives — I also think we should make those things free and universally accessible. I think women’s health and the safety of unborn children is so incredibly important, that I can promise you as Governor all of these things will be included under my healthcare for all plan. Although Sandoval likes to talk about how he’s so great for women’s health choices, he’ll never rise to that level. With a vote for me you can get the best of both worlds — no more infanticide and greatly expanded healthcare for women.</div>

                    <div class="markdown">Once again my opponent attacks without reason to. Where did I say I would strip the government of its regulatory power to ensure corporations don’t prey on the people? Leave it up to a socialist to mince words and get caught up in his own assumptions of what I stand for. If he wants to see what I stand for he can simply check out the bills I’ve written and sponsored, all of which have passed the Assembly and signed into law. I function on the same operating procedures our country has been run on for years, and ones in which our people have voted for consistently. I think it ridiculous that the only other major candidate in this race is one who endorsed the nationalization of several industries. I wouldn’t be surprised, in the event of his unlikely win, if the economy here in Dixie plummets down through the floor. He operates off of an unproven, oppressive, historically bogus ideology which has utterly failed in every single country it has been tried. Power is consolidated at the top with promises of returning money and decision-making to the working man, yet this won’t happen as it never has. I agree with his sentiment on pretty much everything, we just have very few means by which to get there in common, at least mine are tested. For instance in healthcare he simply promises free this and free that. How will he afford this? Taxing Dixians <em>through the roof</em>, and as we’ve already seen he “doesn’t care about the debt”. Where will our state sit following his governorship? Broke and broken. He will tax Dixians to death and he still won’t be able to afford his “plans” of nationalizing industry and providing free everything.

Regarding the labor union bill, I expressed on the floor of the Assembly that the idea is somewhat sound as partnering with unions and private companies to re-evaluate wages can be productive. I voted nay because this bill gave too much teeth to these boards in sponsoring and organizing mass strikes and walkout which can damage our state economy.</div>

                    <div class="markdown">I’m not certain how my opponent can claim he has a much more ambitious plan than myself on abortion when I have consistently talked about increased funding for the very same things. He just happens to promise them for free, but basic economics has taught us that there’s no such thing as a free lunch. Dixie is the only state in a debt hole, and Senator Trash will dig us ever deeper. Under a Sandoval Administration women will have access to better, and cheaper, healthcare as I was the one who sponsored and introduced a bill which granted Dixie entry into the Health Insurance Compact. This is create a regulatory body which ensures people across state lines can buy private, and safe, healthcare for lower costs. Here in Dixie we will help women get access to non-abortive contraception, pregnancy centers, and health counseling. These are all my plans which I have pushed for since my entry into politics. They will be universally accessible under my term in office, guaranteed.

Once again discussing abortion, my views on this are fairly well known. I do not agree with the ban from conception put forth, and it is absolutely disgusting that my opponent here wants women locked up for going through this procedure. I am good for women’s health, Trash is not. Does he know that women who go through an unwanted pregnancy experience worsened mental health? And that their children are more likely to develop deficits in social and cognitive abilities? Or that unsafe pregnancies have, and will, go up further meaning women will die or be seriously harmed by this amendment?

If the amendment is overturned in court my duty is to represent the people and ensure women’s health. It’s quite frightening that my opponent can sit there an claim he’s great for women when he strips them of the right to make decisions over their own body.</div>

I am on the record saying I do agree with Governor Ethan and HHS Secretary Miner’s decisions to begin reopening the state, however we must take extra precautions. This means requiring masks in public, limiting engagement in public parks, and strict enforcement of social distancing rules. I encourage all Dixians to seek out CDC health guidelines regarding the novel coronavirus and follow all protocol to ensure both their and others safety during this time.

As Governor I plan on creating a COVID-19 Task Force, headed by Lt. Governor Order, in reinforcing and crafting new guidelines for statewide rules while the pandemic is yet ongoing, as well as recommending further aid for small business support and individuals affected by it. We have passed a couple great packages early on within the Assembly, however we need to do more now as businesses struggle and many remain unemployed. My hope with this task force is that it includes not only Lt. Gov. Order but also members of the Assembly, my cabinet, and regular citizens in addressing several issues related to coronavirus. This will enable us to build effective packed legislation in a shorter time frame!</div>

                    <div class="markdown">Sandoval, if you had listened to my answers more closely throughout this debate, you would know that I believe the free market activity you propose most often results in mass exploitation. Sure, maybe you didn’t directly say “corporations should oppress people,” but “encouraging private companies to invest” is pretty close. You would go to the  same companies that made poverty possible to reverse it by giving them benefits? That seems counterintuitive to me. For the taxation, my plans would hardly result in much of it. The parts of my economic plan, i.e. strengthening unions, instituting co-ops, and nationalizing a few industries, would hardly cost a dime for taxpayers. And sure, the plans to make college and healthcare free would cost a good amount of money, but it wouldn’t be too difficult to implement. I plan to raise LVT, which mostly impacts the rich, and as part of the gun control and climate change plans I’ll institute a carbon tax and VAT on certain industries and companies where climate change standards are not being met. These taxes are all entirely focused on the rich and wouldn’t affect the majority of the population for whom these reforms would be beneficial. I don’t think we agree on much at all — you want to keep the poor trapped in an endless cycle of violence and exploitation and I want to do everything in my power to rescue them. 

On abortion and women’s health: I’ll admit that you have proposed ideas that help women’s health, it’s simply a question of how far you’re willing to go for the cause. Oh, you’ll vaguely promise to make healthcare more accessible and cheaper for women? That’s good, but how about someone that can give <em>every</em> woman free and universally accessible healthcare, included under my free healthcare plan? That’s the difference. I don’t doubt you’d be alright for women’s health, since just admitting that we have a problem with women’s health in Dixie is a start. I just think you pale in comparison with me, a candidate that will</div>

                    <div class="markdown">on abortion: I continue to take offense with the way you group “abortions” with your plans about “women’s health.” I think I got whiplash from how fast you switched views on abortion. Not even a month ago we worked together on the Right to Life Amendment, which created a ban on abortion from conception in almost all cases. Yet, in the last 2 days, you have slowly been amending that view until today you finally revealed your true colors by saying that you disagree with me on the fact that life begins at conception. That is truly worrying. What is much more worrying, however, is the fact that you got a hefty package of money from an abortion lobbyist shortly after you began switching sides yesterday. For those watching at home or in the crowd, even if you’re pro-choice, we shouldn’t let this kind of corruption take place. We as Dixians should stand together and reject politicians that bend their views at the sight of sweet lobby money. It is bribery, simple as that.</div>

I believe we should close down the state in a few weeks again, using the data from the short reopening we’ve had as a gauge for how Dixie would potentially fare in a real reopening. We should expand testing and mask production by injecting state money into companies that are currently manufacturing those things but just can’t quite keep up with the massive demand we have all over the country. I also think my healthcare for all plan is crucial right now, since too many Dixians are afraid to go see the doctor when they might have coronavirus for fear of going into ridiculous amounts of debt.</div>

Regulatory power will not be stripped from Dixie and we will strike a balance in order to raise up our state as high as possible. Encouraging investment in our state is not “pretty close” to corporate oppression, is that a joke? 

Also, you do not believe that nationalizing several industries would cost a dime? I... I don’t know what to say here because I think you’ve left myself and many others speechless and your inability to grasp the realities of running a functioning government. We don’t live in a made-up world, we live in a reality where we must be pragmatic and smart in our actions with taxpayer money. Furthermore, I’m glad you acknowledge the fact that free college and healthcare would cost a “good amount of money”. Really great inspiring plan there. Socialists run their campaigns on rhetoric and this stuff isn’t even passing the sniff test! We do agree in the institution of an LVT though, I’m sure your running mate isn’t happy with the new taxes considering his new mutualist beliefs... Regarding a carbon tax, are you aware that a carbon tax mainly affects the poor and middle class? It raises the cost of basic utilities and goods. I don’t think you even believe that just the rich would be affected by your tax plan, because that isn’t even realistic. I truly applaud you for wanting to rescue Dixians from a cycle of violence and exploitation, as do I, and I think down the road we can, and will, find common ground.

“Oh you’ll vaguely promise to make healthcare more accessible”. Again, I have made extremely clear promises and have sponsored legislation which accomplishes this. Where are your successes for our state? I see very very few. I do not pale in comparison to you, who has done little when making utterly insane “pie in the sky” campaign promises every election season.</div>

I have been increasingly clear on my opinion in this area and you’re only proving me right by continuing to egg on this topic to score a few political points. 

I took money from a lobbyist who agreed with my ideas. There was no offer or exchange which took place, and I think it’s quite apt that someone who is supposedly on the left donated money to the right-wing candidate... if that doesn’t tell you something then I don’t know what will. It is offensive that you take issue with this when you absolutely looted your own party’s coffers and your entire organization to get enough money to compete with me in campaigning. What ever happened to socialists spreading the wealth and helping your fellow man? Guess that goes out the door during election time. Ludicrous.</div>

                    <div class="markdown">Relying on corporate investment <em>is</em> oppression. As I said, you don’t rely on the people that people that made poverty a problem to begin with to rescue the country. Even if you maintain regulation over the economy, I just don’t think that’s enough. We need an economy that works for the people, not one that works for the rich but has some constraints on it. 

Nationalizing companies would cost less than the other part of the plan, which is why I said it would be “a dime” in comparison to that. I don’t plan on nationalizing all of business or anything, just a few industries like utilities companies that are already worth next to nothing and would be easy to acquire. The rest of the plan would definitely be expensive, but I think you overestimate the amount of money that all of this would cost. Free college is incredibly cheap, with Dixie it would cost just 9.6 billion dollars to implement a tuition match program according to a 2017 study from the Hamilton Project. Healthcare estimates vary, but my plan would cost no more than a few hundred billion dollars per year, which would also cut many costly flaws from our current healthcare system, would help us through the pandemic, and is a good amount smaller than the Dixie budget at the moment, meaning it’s perfectly reasonable. For carbon taxes: the income inequality effect of carbon taxes may not be great, but it can be balanced out by giving the low income households that use a lot of energy additional tax rebates. Still, it’s the most efficient way to stop climate change by directly challenging businesses, which is crucial to slow down this existential threat that we are currently facing.</div>

What is an issue is crony capitalism and corporatism which I am absolutely not a fan of and will fight against as Governor of Dixie. My economy will work for the people and create jobs and higher quality education by which they can be lifted out of poverty. 

Nationalizing companies won’t cost much? Ok let’s take a look at an example. Southern Company is a utility holding company which operates mainly in Dixie, aside from a small bit of territory in the Northern state. It currently has a market capitalization of $62 billion. This is for <strong>one</strong> company, and you will be purchasing many, not to mention bringing billions in operating costs to the Dixie budget each year. Why do you believe the government can run certain industries better than the private sector can? There is no profit motive which leads to innovation and growth in these industries.

Let’s add in your healthcare plan now too, which I’ll take you at your word will cost only “a few hundred billion dollars per year”. We are adding hundreds of billions of dollars to Dixie’s budget with multiple purchases of large corporations, with little guarantee that they won’t be run poorly and give worse service as a government entity. I’m not sure how anyone can hear these talking points and not feel a shiver go up their spine. This scares me to think how reckless a Trash Administration would be and how moral hazard will wreak havoc as the socialists give little regard to stability and feasibility in their plans. My goal is to get us out of debt and reduce the tax burden on every Dixian, especially the poorest of our citizens.</div>

There is a distinct difference between personal beliefs and policy beliefs which I have made incredibly clear! I am <strong>personally</strong> against abortion, however I am not a woman and will never have to make this decision. On the other side I recognize that there is a need and there are vast consequences to bans such as this one, so I do not support a ban from conception. Please try and understand my concerns with a ban, as I have kept my personal beliefs separate. I am not “pro-abortion” in that we don’t <em>want</em> women to get abortions, who would? It can be a dangerous and expensive procedure. What we can do together, however, is reduce the need for one.

For lobby money, you can call it corrupt all you like when it’s not. I’m not taking money from the “abortion lobby” when there was no exchange for favors. The lobbyist liked my views and donated to my campaign! You, on the other hand, looted your party’s entire amount of resources which I find shameful coming from someone who spouts socialist rhetoric. I cannot find a better example of “do as I say not as I do” than what you’ve done during this campaign.</div>

This can be an answer to Senator Trash’s question as well. I would support a cutoff dictated by scientists and specialists in the field. I honestly listen to the people of Dixie in coming to these hard decisions, and will certainly conduct many town halls with my constituents regarding this issue in the event that the courts strike down the RTL Amendment as unconstitutional, which has a high probability.</div>

Southern Company is one of the largest utility companies in Dixie but on average utilities companies are significantly smaller than this one. Plus, you have to consider the fact that the government really only needs to acquire 51% of a company to effectively nationalize it, which means that nationalizing this utility company, which is one of the biggest in the entire country, would cost 31 billion, and most utilities companies would be significantly cheaper to nationalize. Altogether, the cost of nationalizing utilities companies will come out to be around 150-200 billion dollars per year, including operational costs, and this would greatly benefit Dixians who desperately need these services. The concerns about lack of innovation or quality leadership are overblown, since politicians still have an incentive to make sure everything is running smoothly. Public support, which is determined by effectiveness of programs like these, controls the ability of politicians to get re-elected. And, internally, employees can still get fired or demoted for doing their jobs poorly.<span class="chatlog__edited-timestamp" title="07-Jun-20 09:38 PM">(edited)</span></div>

I think that the idea of picking when life begins based on what “scientists and specialists agree upon” is basically nonsensical. First, there is practically no consensus on when life begins. Some so-called scientists and specialists believe that life begins at birth. Some believe that it begins at conception. This is a question that has been impossible to answer by scientists, philosophers, and everyone in between for centuries. That is why I believe life begins at conception. It’s simply the safest option, since anything else introduces the risk that the abortion procedure would be massive infanticide. Second, it’s incredibly vague, and unless you can tell me right now exactly what cutoff point you are in favor of, you need to revise your abortion policy.<span class="chatlog__edited-timestamp" title="07-Jun-20 09:50 PM">(edited)</span></div>

I implore you to look up the top nations for quality of living and you will see many are developed, western nations with liberalized economies. The countries with the highest standards of living survive off of free trade and the exchange of goods between peoples, not state-managed corporations and industries. I grant that some, mainly Scandinavian, nations do exhibit some aspects of socialism but democratic socialism integrated into deeply liberal nations do not represent what Trash is hoping to achieve.</div>

<div class="quote">I implore you to look up the top nations for quality of living and you will see many are developed, western nations with liberalized economies. The countries with the highest standards of living survive off of free trade and the exchange of goods between peoples, not state-managed corporations and industries. I grant that some, mainly Scandinavian, nations do exhibit some aspects of socialism but democratic socialism integrated into deeply liberal nations do not represent what Trash is hoping to achieve.

On abortion once again: “I still don’t see why disallowing abortions is a bad trade off with the issues it causes for women’s health”. OK I am very glad that you openly accept and agree with the fact that it causes issues for women’s health. This is a huge breakthrough in explaining my side of the debate and I see some hope for you yet! You do not seem to understand that my personal views do not trump facts, and it is not your place to attempt to tell me how to apply my own beliefs as Governor. You are correct that there are many various answers as to when life begins, and so I answered you as honestly as I can with “I don’t know”, because that’s the truth.

                    <div class="markdown">I don’t disagree that unwanted pregnancies could theoretically cause some damage to women, the much bigger issue is that you are actively removing a person’s right to life with that change. Some children cause psychological damage to their parents when they act a certain way, does that warrant mass killings of children? I don’t think you have a real answer as to why abortion isn’t mass murder. 

I have explained why nationalization of utilities would be affordable and extremely beneficial to millions of Dixians that struggle to afford electricity or water, which are obviously absolutely crucial. We are a developed country in the year 2020. We can easily afford to provide our citizens with the basic right of electricity and plumbing.

Once again, taking money from your party or from a company that is democratically run by the workers has absolutely no relation to socialism. All that this garbage attack is doing is betraying your lack of understanding of my proposals. Lobbyism as a concept is directly corrupt, and even if you agree with the lobbyists they still ultimately control your views. This is especially proven by the fact that, as you said, you’re <em>personally</em> against abortion but for the sake of your political life (and lobby money), you don’t think life begins at conception. That is bribery, end of story.</div>

                    <div class="markdown">your answers on abortion continue to baffle me. How can you say so many words, yet convey so little of substance? Yes, I think we should listen to the people. The people made it clear that they want a ban on abortion. The fact is that it’s a lot better to assume life begins at conception in order to limit the risk that we are actively killing children with abortions. You continue to dodge this question. Abortion is murder, it’s really as simple as that. It’s immoral to publicly stand for the pro-choice movement when you can’t explain why abortion <em>isn’t</em> an endorsement of infanticide.</div>

Is associating via cooperatives really a &quot;freedom&quot; when neoliberal banking systems consistently refuse to give startup capital to promising cooperatives due to cultural differences and issues with multiple cosignatories and thus pressures the average worker to labor in a corporate environment instead of one where he is free to be a productive and fulfilled worker?</div>

Are you serious with this? Are we to go on about this until the end of time? My views are increasingly clear on this subject. I am opposed to the ban, I am opposed to abortion myself, however I recognize the need for women to get one. Your amendment and bills will hurt women’s health and even lock some up, extremely despicable and sad.

Regarding you taking all of the resources at your party’s disposal, ok sure. You can call donations to my campaign corrupt all you like but that doesn’t make it true. Is it corrupt for a person to donate money to someone they agree with on policy? Nope. And yes it is ironic that you stole all of the resources at your disposal, including from the party you lead and the paper you run. And you didn’t even spend it all! This is ironic, a socialist took all of the money for himself and spent it unwisely. A tale as old as time.</div>

Once again, framing the abortion in this debate as “infanticide” vs “pro-life” is doing so in bad faith and it makes it incredibly difficult to make any headway in an argument. If I don’t believe that life begins at conception then, no, I am not “condoning the murder of children” and I find it pathetic that you would apply that logic to 47% of Dixians, who I assure you are not content with slaughtering children.

 The conversation I had with a lobbyist was a single question and a single answer, no exchange. To claim it as bribery is utterly laughable when the donation was made based on policy views and values I already hold. You, on the other hand, is it not suspect that the head of a party and the head of the AWP happens to receive every dollar of funding when other socialists need the money just as much? I wouldn’t expect too much from someone that heads the party of genocide deniers and Soviet Squidward.</div>

                    <div class="markdown">I don’t really care whether you dislike my framing of the abortion debate. It is the <em>safest assumption</em> that abortion is murder because anything else leaves open the possibility that we are killing innocent children. That is simply a true statement. You can’t seem to accept that, and in trying to ignore it, you are perpetuating the same ignorance around abortion and murder. The 47% of Dixians that voted against the RTL Amendment have the right to hold whatever opinions they want, but that doesn’t take away from the fact that their beliefs logically support murder, even if they don’t directly put it that way. 

No, it’s not “suspect” that I got all of the money from the party and the awp. For the party, the NCP democratically voted to give me all the funds. For the awp, I talked with jogod and we also held a democratic vote among the workers of the company. Both of those things are perfectly reasonable. On the other hand, taking money from an external agent like a lobbyist is significantly worse simply because there is no democratic process and there is no transparency. I was given funding because I am the best option for the workers, and I line up with the left wing party I’m in. You were given money because you bent your will to a shady external agent. There’s a stark difference there. 

P.S. genocide deniers are not allowed into the party as per the constitution and Squidward was banned as quickly as possible by the party. You’re just beating a dead horse that didn’t even have a lot of life in it while it was alive.<span class="chatlog__edited-timestamp" title="07-Jun-20 11:38 PM">(edited)</span></div>

It is people like you who perpetuate invasive and draconian policies which negatively affect women everywhere, not just in Dixie. I have a concrete plan for helping women get access to means which will raise them up economically as well as ensure the abortion rate goes down. You yourself have admitted that in localities where abortion is illegal women go through dangerous operations to get them anyways. I’m not sure how any person can support a law which makes women felons for wanting to regulate their own body. It is both disgusting and despicable. Many experts do not agree that life begins at conception, and so it will be my duty, in case of the overturning of the ban, to consult with experts and doctors on the best course of action. My <em>number one</em> priority is decreasing the need for abortion, which will involve education reform, healthcare reform, and many other novel policies only I will be able to get passed through the Assembly and into law.

Regarding your shady dealings in funding this election, I am simply pointing out the irony of looting all funding available, which you can claim was democratic but I doubt it, and writing a check to yourself, and not even using it all. We can use this to explain exactly what would happen in a, hopefully, hypothetical Trash governorship: the state appropriates billions from unwilling taxpayers, a lot more than likely is lost due to corruption and cronyism, and last but not least the government misuses and mismanages funds badly.

There was no shady external agent. I am proud of my beliefs and nobody can claim otherwise. To receive funding for being a man of action is an honor and I hope to make all of my voters proud!

You can say Soviet Squidward was a one-off, but you put him up for election and it took way too long to expel him.</div>

                    <div class="markdown">I would simply like to close this off with a final reminder of what the Trash campaign is about. This is a campaign for the people. This is a reclamation of your rights, your money, your power over the government, your life. I plan to implement wide sweeping reforms the likes of which have never been seen in Dixie and deconstruct capitalism once and for all. Throughout this debate, I have shown that we are currently stuck in a system that exploits workers and, vampirically sucks the surplus labor from the backs of Dixians. Sandoval’s weak capitalist reforms change are part of the same structure of deceit that made violence possible in the first place. In the words of the great Friedrich Engels, “every step of real movement is more important than a dozen programmes.” Today, we solidly take a step to end capitalism with the largest worker movement in history!<span class="chatlog__edited-timestamp" title="07-Jun-20 11:59 PM">(edited)</span></div>

                    <div class="markdown">In conclusion, my campaign is run on small-government beliefs which seek to utilize the government not as an invasive tool, but as a guide for both our constituents and private industry in growing every sector of our economy. We will use funding for necessary projects in education reform, expanding access to affordable healthcare and prescription drugs, repairing and rebuilding our dwindling infrastructure such as roads, schools, bridges, and increasing access to high-speed fiber optic internet, continuing to battle the coronavirus epidemic, and paying off the debt while seeking out future tax reform. 

I believe these policies to be the best course of action here in Dixie and if so honored as to be selected as the next Governor I will absolutely make every single Dixian proud. God bless you all and may God bless our great state!!</div>
